industry for many years, and Bob is a Chartered Gas Engineer.

<p>
Tricia began her career in the gas industry twenty years ago with Transco,
now known as Cadent, using specialist network analysis software to assess
the options for replacing iron gas mains networks with polyethylene
systems.
Tricia also usedÂ network analysis models to assess the impacts of adding
new customer connections and proposing reinforcement solutions to keep
the network within specific operating parameters.
</p>
<p>
Tricia has also worked for a pipe installation contractor and an
independent gas transporter in a support and compliance role,
maintaining high standards of records to satisfy rigorous
health, safety, quality and environmental requirements
and making sure technical staff were kept up-to-date
with the latest training.

to keep the gas network operating safely and efficiently.
As well as having a long career with British Gas and its successors, he
has worked for Utility Infrastructure Provider companies (UIPs) and

companies.
