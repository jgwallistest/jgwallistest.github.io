two-day Open Retriever Trial at Lilac Farm, Eastmoor, near Kings
Lynn by kind permission of Mr. Will Chapman.</p><p>Judges were Mr. Phil Allan, Mr. Tim Brain, Mrs. Gaynor Gent and Mrs.
Charlotte Jeffery.</p><p>Mr. Richard Bickerleg was the Steward of the Beat and, as always,
provided us with splendid conditions which were matched with fair
weather and good shooting by our faithful team of guns led by Bob
Hales.</p><p>The trial was well supported with 118 entries and the full card of
24 started with a walked-up drive over sugar beet.
We dropped a number of dogs in the first round and a duck drive
for the second round concluded the day with 10 dogs remaining
to go forward to the second day.</p><p>On Saturday, and once again blessed with good weather, the second
round was swiftly concluded and the third round gave some fine
work and handling, the usual few examples of hard luck, and
the fourth round brought the trial to a time conclusion,
with the first three dogs being very closely judged.</p><p>The result was:</p><ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet"><li>1st &ndash; Mrs. L. Hills&rsquo; Stauntonvale Tic Bean</li><li>2nd &ndash; Mrs. Sharon Dingle&rsquo;s Belspaddle Intrepid</li><li>3rd &ndash; Mrs. Louie Robertson&rsquo;s FtCh. Mitforton Macho</li></ul><p>Certificates of Merit went to Ronnie Laughton&rsquo;s Wytonruss Finnegan
and also Mr. Wayne Mitchell&rsquo;s Turpingreen Barrera of Labdom, who
also received the trophy for the Gun&rsquo;s Choice.</p><p>Warm thanks to all who assisted and contributed to making this such a
successful and great trial.</p><h2 class=uk-h2>Report on the Novice Retriever Trial on 8th January 2018</h2><p>We returned to Lilac Farm, Eastmoor, near Kings Lynn for our third and
final Retriever Trial of the 2017-2018 season.
Mr. Will Chapman kindly invited us back to his grounds, and Richard
Bickerleg, the Chief Steward, once again provided us with
outstanding grounds and game.
This Novice competition was well supported with almost 50 entries.
Judges were Phil Parkins, Mike Skipper, Paul Truby and David Wall
with Bob Hales once again providing a crack team of guns for the
day.</p><p>We began with a walked-up drive through a copse, moved through to
standing game crop and completed the first drive with a number of
birds which dropped into rough, marshy ground on the far side of
a wide ditch.
This proved a bit challenging for some of the really novice dogs
and a number went out.
However, it tested obedience, game finding and retrieving skills
and it became clear we had a very interesting competition on.
We proceeded with another walked-up drive, and this was
sufficient to complete the trial.</p><p>First prize and the C. J. Moorhouse trophy went to Henrik
Vilendal&rsquo;s Vilendal Quasimodo, and second prize was
awarded to Barry Taylor&rsquo;s Valleyend Arndilly in a
very close finish.
A Certificate of Merit and Gun&rsquo;s Choice went to
Keith Townsend&rsquo;s Elmertown Special One.
All three dogs were worthy of awards and the two
runners-up will surely be winning soon.</p><p>Thank you to all the cheery helpers and fellow competitors who stayed for
the prize-giving, which made for a celebratory feel to the close of our
season.
A thoroughly enjoyable day.
We wish you all a good summer and look forward to meeting again for the
2018 season.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><h2 class=uk-h2>Result of the Open Springer Stake at High House on 22nd December 2017</h2><ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet"><li>1st &ndash; I.
